# :iphone: Matching-app feature
## :musical_note: Description
For Block-web we have to create a feauture for a matching-webapp. We learn to work with Git/GitHub, Node.js, Express & EJS.

My target audience for this project are people who want to find other people to go to concerts/festivals with. The match is based on the music taste.

## :computer: How to install
If you want to use my feature, you can do so by following **two simple steps**: 
1. Clone the repository by running this code in your terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Sophievanderburg/blok-tech.git
```
2. Install all the npm packages by running this code in your terminal:
```
$ npm install
```
You should see a node_modules folder in the root when it is finished.
And then you are good to go! :thumbsup: </br>
When you want to run the server, run this code in your terminal:
```
$ npm run dev
```
