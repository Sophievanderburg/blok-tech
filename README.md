# :iphone: Matching-app feature
## Description
For Block-web we have to create a feauture for a matching-webapp. We learn to work with Git/GitHub, Node.js, Express & EJS.

My target audience for this project are people who want to find other people to go to concerts/festivals with. The match is based on the music taste.
